      "description": "Revealer moves any player currently on Tortuga or a Rowboat to the back of the line of either ship. Revealer may also save this card and use it as a future action.\n\nUsing it as a future action costs that entire future turn. In 2-player games (where you get 2 actions each turn instead of 1), if you reveal a Letter of Marque and immediately use it, that counts as 1 action.\n\nIf you reveal and save a Letter of Marque, that counts as 1 action. If you play a Letter of Marque that was saved in an earlier turn, that also counts as 1 action.",
